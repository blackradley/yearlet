# Data Mining Experiment

## What?

Currently just a demonstration package that searches for and classifies tweets.

However, it demonstrates an architecture with:

* a packaged API wrapper <https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-and-testing-an-api-wrapper-in-python>, 
* tests <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html> and 
* a unicode sandwich <http://johnbachman.net/building-a-python-23-compatible-unicode-sandwich.html>

## How?

Install the supporting packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the demo

```
python main.py
```

Run the tests
```
pytest
```
